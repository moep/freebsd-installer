A collection of scripts to automate my personal FreeBSD 13 installation.
You will be better off of using the handbook and bsdinstall. 
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK OR YOU WILL probably LOSE DATA!

1. Prerequisites
================

The installation requires a device with an SSL client.
The target machine requires a dedicated hard drive. (By limiting the root partition size you can leave space for other OSs.)
Clone this project and cd into it.
Download FreeBSD-13.0-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img.xz and write it to a USB stick:

  dd if=FreeBSD-13.0-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img.xz of=/dev/yourUsbStick bs=1m

2. Preparing the Target Machine
===============================
Boot from USB and close the TUI installer. Exec csh to get a more comfortable shell.

$ csh

Use gpart to read / verfiy your disk identifiers.

$ gpart show

Edit install.sh's parameters to suit your needs.
Start SSHD on the target machine.

$ mkdir /tmp/etc
$ mount_unionfs /tmp/etc /etc

# Create a network connection.
$ dhclient ue0
# or
$ ifconfig ue0 192.168.0.6/24 up
$ route add default 192.168.0.1
$ echo "nameserver 192.168.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf

$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config # PermitRootLogin=yes
$ passwd
$ service sshd onestart

Copy the installation scripts and files to the target machine.

$ scp *.sh root@target:/tmp
$ scp conf/* root@target:/tmp

3. Installation
===============
Review and change the installation script if needed.

$ vi /tmp/install.sh
Execute install.sh on the target machine and follow the instructions.

$ sh /tmp/install.sh

In case something goes wrong and retry fails because of "multiple zfs pools" try the following:

$ zpool labelclear -f /dev/yourTargedDevice

The script will ask if you want to add an entry to your EFI NVRAM. You should choose yes here.
This will not install a boot manager though. 

Optional: Install rEFInd

4. Post Installation
====================

Start you newly installed OS.
Run post-install.sh.

$ sh /root/post-install.sh

Cleanup.

$ rm /root/functions.sh 
$ rm /root/post-install.sh
